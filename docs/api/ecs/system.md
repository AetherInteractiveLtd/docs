## :material-cube: System

// what is a system

#### System Parameters

`#!typescript after?: Array<System>`

 : An optional set of systems must be executed before this system. This is useful for ensuring that a system is executed after another system (e.g. when a system relies on the data generated by another system).

`#!typescript dt?: number`

 : The delta time, in seconds, since the last call of this system. This is useful for systems that need to update based on time, such as physics systems.

`#!typescript enabled?: boolean`

 : Whether or not a system should be called. This should not be called directly. Instead, you should use the [`#!typescript world.enableSystem()`](../api/world.md/#markdown "World.enableSystem()") and [`#!typescript world.disableSystem()`](../api/world.md/#markdown "World.disableSystem()") functions respectively.

`#!typescript executionGroup?: ExecutionGroup`

 : The group that this system will be executed on, e.g. PostSimulation, PreAnimation, etc. The only requirement for an execution group is that the group has a `Connect` method.

`#!typescript name?: string`

 : The name of the system. This is primarily used for debugging purposes.

`#!typescript priority?: number`

 : The priority of the system. Systems with a higher priority will be executed before systems with a lower priority. This number defaults to `0`, and therefore can be either positive or negative.

### :material-function-variant: **`#!typescript public abstract onUpdate(world: World): void`** { #markdown data-toc-label='onUpdate' }

The onUpdate method is called on every execution of this systems execution group. This should not typically be called manually, and instead, the system should be scheduled according to an execution group using the [`#!typescript world.scheduleSystem()`](../api/world.md/#markdown "World.scheduleSystem()") function.

#### Parameters
`#!typescript world: World`

 : The world that this system is being executed on. This will be automatically passed in by the owning world on each system execution.

### :material-function-variant: **`#!typescript public configureQueries(world: World): void`** { #markdown data-toc-label='configureQueries' }

The configureQueries method is optionally called when the system is first run. This is typically used to configure the queries that the system will use, however, it can also be used to perform any other setup logic as required.

#### Parameters
`#!typescript world: World`

 : The world that this system is being executed on. This will be automatically passed in by the owning world.
